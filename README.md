# GH-Auto-Uploader
‚≠êUpload folders containing 100+ files in seconds!

Github only lets you drag in folders containing 100 or less files at a time. This means that you'd have to manually create a new folder in your repository and upload your files 100 by 100. With this program you'll be able to simply place your file in the program's directory, enter some information and have the files automatically uploaded and placed into a single folder in your specified repository.
# How to use

Using this program is pretty simple! Drag the folder you want to upload into the same directory the .py file is in, run the program and enter the required information. Note: The folder name you enter before running the bot must be exactly the same as the name on the folder you have placed in the .py file's directory.
